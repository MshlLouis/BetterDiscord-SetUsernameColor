# A script for BetterDiscord that lets the user customize the color for Usernames in DMs

## Have you ever been on a server and enjoyed the colorful chat with your friends? And then you went to your DMs and everyones username was just plain white?

This plugin aims to provide a solution for this problem. Once downloaded and installed you can open the plugins settings which will show this window:

![settings1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea8b8abd-c6d5-4844-b2f9-d650589d56aa)



Once you click "Add Username" you'll be given the option to add a user and a color:

![settings2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/213aef49-d669-4713-91c0-4129a9892802)



The color is of the format RGBA, meaning you have three color channels and one alpha channel. The alpha channel controls opacity from 0-1, meaning 0-100%. At 0 the username is invisible. Change the values for RGB to your liking. Once you're done click "Done". Now whenever you go to your DMs the username will have the color you chose.
